## Overview

Technicians earn commissions based on their revenue contributions and performance. Several key components determine how the commission is calculated:

1. Revenue Sources and Definitions
2. Calculating Service Completion Percentage (SCP) and Install Contribution Percentage (ICP)
3. Determining Weekly Sales Thresholds Based on SCP and ICP
4. Adjusting Sales Thresholds for Paid Days Off
5. Applying Threshold Reductions for Tech Generated Leads (TGLs)
6. Understanding Spiffs and Their Impact
7. Calculating Commission Rate and Commission Amount
8. Calculating Total Pay, Including Spiffs and TGL Spiffs

## 1. Revenue Sources and Definitions

### Scenario 1 - Completed Job Revenue (CJR):
- Definition: Revenue from jobs that the technician completes directly without involving other teams.
- Notation: Box A
- Example: If a technician completes a repair job worth $500, this amount is added to Box A.

### Scenario 2 - Tech-Sourced Install Sales (TSIS):
- Definition: Revenue from installs initiated by the technician but completed by another team or department.
- Notation: Box B
- Example: If a technician convinces a customer to install a new appliance worth $500, this amount is added to Box B.

### Total Revenue:
- Definition: The sum of Completed Job Revenue (Box A) and Tech-Sourced Install Sales (Box B).
- Notation: Box C
- Formula: `Box C = Box A + Box B`
- Example: If Box A is $5,790 and Box B is $13,860, then Box C is $19,650.

## 2. Calculating Service Completion Percentage (SCP) and Install Contribution Percentage (ICP)

### Service Completion Percentage (SCP):
- Definition: The percentage of total revenue generated from jobs completed directly by the technician.
- Formula: `SCP = (Box A / Box C) × 100`
- Rounding: SCP is rounded to the nearest 10% using the "Round Half Up" method.
- Example: `SCP = (5,790 / 19,650) × 100 = 29.49% → 30%`

### Install Contribution Percentage (ICP):
- Definition: The percentage of total revenue from tech-sourced installs.
- Formula: `ICP = (Box B / Box C) × 100`
- Rounding: ICP is rounded to the nearest 10% using the "Round Half Up" method.
- Example: `ICP = (13,860 / 19,650) × 100 = 70.51% → 70%`

## 3. Determining Weekly Sales Thresholds Based on SCP and ICP

Technicians qualify for different commission rates based on their SCP and ICP percentages. Each combination of SCP and ICP corresponds to a set of weekly sales thresholds and commission rates.

### Commission Rates:
- Commission rates range from 2% to 5%.
- Thresholds: There are four sales thresholds corresponding to the commission rates.
  - Below the lowest threshold: 0% commission.
  - Above the highest threshold: Highest commission rate (5%).

|Flipped%| Sales Thresholds                    | Commission Rates |
|--------|-------------------------------------|------------------|
|  0     | $7,000; $8,000; $9,000; $10,000     |   2%; 3%; 4%; 5% |

|  100    | $18,000; $20,000; $22,000; $24,000 |   2%; 3%; 4%; 5% |

## 4. Adjusting Sales Thresholds for Paid Days Off

### Adjustment Rules:
- Reduction Factor: For each paid day off, reduce the thresholds by 20%.
- Maximum Reduction: Up to 5 days off (100% reduction).

### Calculation Example:
- Original Thresholds: $9,000; $10,000; $11,000; $12,000
- Days Off: 1 day
- Reduction Factor: `Reduction Factor = 1 − (0.20 × 1) = 0.80`
- Adjusted Thresholds: `$9,000 × 0.80 = $7,200`

## 5. Applying Threshold Reductions for Tech Generated Leads (TGLs)

### Threshold Reduction for TGLs:
- Purpose: To make it easier for technicians to reach higher commission tiers.
- Reduction Amount: Average ticket value multiplied by the number of TGLs.
- Formula: `Total Threshold Reduction = Average Ticket Value × Number of TGLs`

### Department Rules for TGL Spiffs
- TGL spiffs (2% of TGL revenue) are only awarded when the technician generates a lead for their own department
- Departments are determined by Business Unit number ranges:
  - HVAC: Business Units 20-29
  - Plumbing: Business Units 30-39
  - Electric: Business Units 40-49
- Example: An HVAC technician (Business Unit 25) who generates a lead for:
  - HVAC (Business Unit 20-29): Receives 2% TGL spiff
  - Plumbing (Business Unit 30-39): No TGL spiff
  - Electric (Business Unit 40-49): No TGL spiff
- The threshold reduction benefit applies regardless of department

### Adjusted Thresholds After TGL Reduction:
`Adjusted Threshold = max(0, Adjusted Threshold − Total Threshold Reduction)`

### Example:
- Tickets Sold: $1,000, $1,100, $1,050, $1,114.24
- Average Ticket Value: `(1,000 + 1,100 + 1,050 + 1,114.24) / 4 = $1,066.06`
- Number of TGLs: 2
- Total Threshold Reduction: `$1,066.06 × 2 = $2,132.12`
- Adjusted Threshold: `Adjusted Threshold = Original Threshold − $2,132.12`

## 6. Understanding Spiffs and Their Impact

### Spiffs Calculation:
- Definition: Spiffs are additional bonuses or incentives earned by the technician.
- Impact on Calculations:
  - Not added to total revenue for threshold qualification.
  - Subtracted from total revenue when calculating commissionable revenue.

### Example with Spiffs:
- Total Revenue (Box C): $9,900
- Spiffs: $200
- Adjusted Revenue for Thresholds: `$9,900` (Spiffs not added)

## 7. Calculating Commission Rate and Commission Amount

### Adjusted Revenue for Threshold Qualification:
- Formula: `Adjusted Revenue = Total Revenue`
  (Spiffs and TGL Spiffs are not added)

### Commission Rate Determination:
- Compare Adjusted Revenue to Adjusted Thresholds.
- Select the commission rate corresponding to the highest threshold met.

### Commissionable Revenue:
- Formula: `Commissionable Revenue = Total Revenue − Spiffs − Total TGL Spiffs`

### Commission Calculation:
- Formula: `Commission = Commissionable Revenue × Commission Rate`

### Example Calculation:
- Total Revenue: $8,528.50
- Spiffs: $225.00
- TGL Revenues: $16,863 and $17,680
- Total TGL Spiffs (2% of TGL Revenues): `(16,863 × 0.02) + (17,680 × 0.02) = $690.86`
- Adjusted Revenue for Threshold Qualification: `$8,528.50` (Spiffs and TGL Spiffs not added)
- Adjusted Thresholds After TGL Reduction: (From previous example in Section 5)
- Commission Rate: Determined based on Adjusted Revenue and Adjusted Thresholds
- Commissionable Revenue: `8,528.50 − 225.00 − 690.86 = $7,612.64`
- Commission: `7,612.64 × Commission Rate`

## 8. Calculating Total Pay, Including Spiffs and TGL Spiffs

### Total Pay Calculation:
- Formula: `Total Pay = Commission + Spiffs + Total TGL Spiffs`

### Example:
- Commission: $152.25
- Spiffs: $225.00
- Total TGL Spiffs: $690.86
- Total Pay: `152.25 + 225.00 + 690.86 = $1,068.11`

## 9. Step-by-Step Calculation Summary

1. Calculate SCP and ICP:
   - Use the provided formulas.
   - Round to the nearest 10% using "Round Half Up."

2. Find Commission Tier:
   - Match SCP and ICP with the corresponding thresholds and rates in the department's commission table.

3. Adjust Thresholds for Days Off:
   - Apply a 20% reduction per paid day off.

4. Apply TGL Threshold Reduction (if applicable):
   - Reduce thresholds based on the average ticket value multiplied by the number of TGLs.

5. Determine Adjusted Revenue for Threshold Qualification:
   - Use total revenue (do not include Spiffs or TGL Spiffs).

6. Determine Commission Rate:
   - Compare Adjusted Revenue to Adjusted Thresholds.
   - Select the appropriate commission rate.

7. Calculate Commissionable Revenue:
   - Subtract Spiffs and Total TGL Spiffs from total revenue.

8. Calculate Commission:
   - Multiply Commissionable Revenue by the Commission Rate.

9. Calculate Total Pay:
   - Add Commission, Spiffs, and Total TGL Spiffs.

## 10. Additional Notes

- Rounding Percentages: SCP and ICP are rounded to the nearest 10% using "Round Half Up."
- Handling No Matching Commission Tier: If no commission tier matches the SCP and ICP, the technician may not qualify for a commission.
- Edge Cases:
  - Zero Total Revenue: If total revenue is zero, SCP and ICP are zero.
  - Negative Adjusted Thresholds: Thresholds cannot be negative; use zero as the minimum.

### Key Takeaways:
- Accurate Rounding: Ensure SCP and ICP are correctly rounded to the nearest 10%.
- Threshold Adjustments: Account for paid days off and TGLs when adjusting thresholds.
- Spiffs Handling: Do not add Spiffs to total revenue for threshold qualification; subtract them when calculating commissionable revenue.
- TGL Spiffs: Do not add TGL Spiffs to total revenue for threshold qualification; subtract them when calculating commissionable revenue.
- Total Pay Calculation: Follow the outlined steps to calculate total pay accurately.
